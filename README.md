# PolycryptZero (p0) - Hash Cracking Tool

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-green.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v1.0-orange.svg)](https://github.com/bitArtisan1/p0-Decryption-Tool/releases)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Windows-lightgrey.svg)

A hash cracking tool with GUI that supports multiple attack methods and hash algorithms. It includes support for a probabilistic mode which uses a GPT2 style autoregressive transformer model, trained for password generation and prediction.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Attack Modes**: Wordlist, Brute-force, Rule-based, AI-powered probabilistic, Rainbow tables
- 🔒 **Hash Support**: MD5, SHA family, bcrypt, BLAKE2, and 20+ other algorithms  
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Custom GPT2 ML model for intelligent password generation and completion
- 🌈 **Rainbow Tables**: Bloom filter optimized storage with SQLite backend
- 🎨 **Modern GUI**: Dark theme interface with real-time progress tracking

`Probablistic` mode uses an autoregressive transformer model, similar to GPT-2, for sequential data analysis:

**Key Features: (check src/train.py)**

*   **Transformer Architecture:** Employs multi-layer, multi-head self-attention mechanisms.
*   **Generative:** Predicts subsequent elements in a sequence.
*   **Configurable:** Core parameters like layers, attention heads, and embedding dimensions can be adjusted.
  
## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Executable (Windows)
Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/bitArtisan1/p0-Decryption-Tool/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and run `PolycryptZero.exe` - no Python required.

### Option 2: Python Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitArtisan1/p0-Decryption-Tool.git
cd p0-Decryption-Tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

#### 📋 Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11+
- **Dependencies**: `customtkinter`, `pycryptodome`, `numpy`, `onnxruntime`, `transformers`


## 🚀 Usage

1. Enter target hash
2. Select hash algorithm 
3. Choose attack mode
4. Configure parameters (wordlist, character set, etc.)
5. Start attack

For `Wordlist` and `Rule-Based` modes, you need a passwords wordlist to test against (e.g: `rockyou.txt`):

```cmd
curl -LO https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt
```

For probablistic mode, choose the provided `onnx_model-output` directory

## ⚔️ Attack Modes

- 📚 **Wordlist**: Dictionary attack using password lists 
- 💪 **Brute-force**: Try all possible combinations
- ⚙️ **Rule-based**: Apply transformations to wordlist (capitalization, leet speak, etc.)
- 🧠 **Probabilistic**: AI model generates likely passwords, use provided `onnx_model_output` path
- 🌈 **Rainbow Table**: Precomputed hash lookups

## TODO

- Improve model architecture for better pattern matching
- Add linux support release
- Add CUDA GPU support for probablistic attack mode
